# Java-User-Input-Calculator

## Java 152 Class Lab: Basic Java Concepts
This lab, part of the Java 152 class at New Mexico State University with Professor Karina Sigala, focuses on fundamental Java concepts. The objectives include writing arithmetic expressions, using casting to convert between primitive types, utilizing library methods and constants, manipulating string data, and communicating with the user using the Scanner class or dialog boxes.

## Introduction
The lab delves into correcting logic errors, exploring mathematical formulas in Java, and understanding the difference between integer division and division on calculators. It introduces the Math class for preprogrammed mathematical operations, such as raising a number to a power or using pi. Additionally, it covers user communication through console input/output and introduces GUI programming using the JOptionPane class. The lab also covers string processing using the String class.

## Lab Objectives
Write arithmetic expressions
Use casting for type conversion
Utilize library methods and constants
Manipulate string data using String methods
Communicate with users using Scanner class or dialog boxes
Create programs from algorithms
Document programs with comments for clarity and maintainability
